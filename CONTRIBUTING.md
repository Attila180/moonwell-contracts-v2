# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to Moonwell V2 Contracts

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue] to suggest a feature or report a minor bug.

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed
issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially
around the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritized according to the
impact they may have on the ecosystem, so we appreciate information showing that
the impact could be high.

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute to code that doesn't include any changes to the
protocol you may do so by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

Any non-trivial code contribution must be first discussed with the maintainers
in an issue (see [Opening an issue](#opening-an-issue)). Only very minor changes
are accepted without prior discussion.

Run linter, prettier and tests to make sure your pull request is good before
submitting it.

If you're looking for a good place to start, look for issues labelled
["good first issue"](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/labels/good%20first%20issue)!

## Protocol changes

Moonwell V2 is a decentralized protocol, and we are committed to decentralizing
its development. If you would like to propose a change to the protocol, please
follow the [governance process](./gocs/GOVPROPOSAL.md).
