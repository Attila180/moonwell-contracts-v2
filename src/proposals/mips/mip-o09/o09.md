# MIP-O09 Correcting WELL Rewards Allocation on the VELO Market

## Summary

This proposal aims to correct a mistake in the allocation of September's WELL
rewards to the VELO market on Optimism. Through the execution of MIP-O07 and
MIP-MO08, WELL rewards were mistakenly applied to the old, deprecated v1 VELO
market instead of the more recently established VELO v2 market. This proposal
seeks to remove the incentives from the deprecated market and reallocate them to
the correct VELO v2 market.

## Background

In a recent rewards speed adjustment proposal, rewards were intended to be
distributed to the newly established VELO v2 market on Optimism. However, due to
an oversight, the rewards were mistakenly applied to the deprecated VELO market.
The root cause of this issue was the use of an outdated market address
(deprecated VELO V1 market) during proposal generation. The branch used for
generating the proposal calldata contained the deprecated market address in the
file where all the addresses are kept. The commit that changed the market
address was in another PR, which had yet to be merged when the proposal went
live. This commit has since been merged and this error should not take place
again.

The specific proposals that led to this mistake was **MIP-O07 and MIP-O08
Automated Liquidity Incentive Proposals**. This proposal was divided into two
parts due to gas limit constraints on the Moonbeam Network. MIP-O07 was intended
to distribute and adjust liquidity incentives for the period beginning
2024-09-06 and ending on 2024-10-04.

## Proposal Details

This proposal will:

1. **Remove WELL Rewards from Deprecated VELO Market:**
   - Remove the mistakenly allocated WELL supply and borrow rewards from the
     deprecated VELO market on Optimism.
2. **Allocate WELL Rewards to the Correct VELO v2 Market:**

   - Correctly allocate the WELL supply and borrow rewards to the VELO v2 market
     on Optimism.

3. **Update End Times:**
   - Ensure that the end times for these rewards align with the originally
     intended schedule.

## Rationale

It is essential to ensure that rewards are distributed accurately and
efficiently to maintain user trust and the integrity of the rewards distribution
system. Although the amount of WELL rewards mistakenly allocated to the
deprecated market is relatively small, reallocating them to the correct market
is necessary to avoid any confusion or potential issues.

## Conclusion

This proposal is a corrective action to ensure that the WELL rewards are
properly allocated to the intended market. By approving this proposal, the
community will help maintain the integrity and transparency of the rewards
distribution process.
