## Summary

This proposal seeks to extend and optimize the highly successful Moonwell Morpho
Vaults incentives program for an additional 6-month period and transfer
ownership of the newly created Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault to the Moonwell
DAO. Since launching on Base in July 2024, the Moonwell Flagship Vaults have
emerged as the dominant market leader on
[Morpho's](https://app.morpho.org/?network=base) Base deployment, with a current
TVL of $170M, and demonstrating unmatched growth and adoption. Given the
program's success and the significant appreciation in WELL token value since the
initial grant, we propose a revised incentive program of 18M WELL tokens for the
next 6 months (reduced from 50M). This proposal also introduces the Moonwell
Frontier cbBTC Vault, designed to capitalize on the growing demand for cbBTC
borrowing demand within the Base ecosystem, positioning Moonwell to attract
additional cbBTC liquidity and borrowing activity.

## Success of Initial Program

Since the activation of Moonwell Flagship Vaults in July 2024, we have achieved
exceptional growth and overwhelming market dominance.

### Current Vault TVL:

- **Moonwell Flagship ETH Vault:** 30,309.32 WETH ($116.64M)
- **Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault:** 42.34M USDC ($42.33M)
- **Moonwell Flagship EURC Vault:** 11.07M EURC ($11.55M)
- **Total TVL:** $170.52M

### Market Dominance:

- **Moonwell Flagship Vaults represent 83% of all Morpho Vault TVL on Base.**
- **Flagship ETH Vault:** Nearly 11x larger than the next largest ETH vault (Re7
  WETH at $10.75M).
- **Flagship USDC Vault ($42.33M):** 15x larger than the next largest USDC vault
  (Gauntlet USDC Core at $2.87M).
- **Flagship EURC Vault ($11.55M):** 49x larger than the next largest EURC vault
  (Gauntlet EURC Core at $234.28k).

### Key Achievements:

- Explosive Growth: In October alone, the
  [Moonwell Flagship Vaults achieved a 224% TVL increase](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/block-analitica-b-protocol-moonwell-flagship-vaults-monthly-recap-october-2024/1372)
- Market Leadership: Moonwell Flagship Vaults dominate key lending markets:
  - 95% of the wstETH/ETH market (~$28M borrowed)
  - 82% of the cbBTC/USDC market (~$10.1M borrowed)
  - 99% of the wstETH/USDC market (~$12M borrowed)
- Broad Adoption: 22,000+ total depositors across the Moonwell Flagship Vaults
- Technical Advancements: Implementation of Block Analitica's state-of-the-art
  vault allocation model has enhanced:
  - Risk-adjusted returns for suppliers
  - Profitable leveraging for borrowers
  - Competitive market rates through dynamic reallocation
  - Conservative risk management with blue-chip collateral

This remarkable performance validates our thesis about the demand for optimized
lending within the Moonwell and Morpho ecosystems. It also highlights Block
Analitica and B.Protocol's robust risk management expertise and continued
pursuit of further innovation.

## Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault

### Why Frontier Instead of Flagship?

The Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault represents an expansion into higher-yield
liquidity strategies designed to attract sophisticated DeFi participants. Unlike
the Moonwell Flagship Vaults, which focus on supplying into more conservative,
blue-chip markets, the Frontier Vault series allows users to supply assets that
are strategically deployed into more risk-on Morpho markets like emerging
Bitcoin derivative markets, enhancing liquidity and borrowing opportunities
across the ecosystem.

#### Key Reasons for Differentiating as "Frontier" Include:

- **Higher Risk/Reward Profile:**  
  The Frontier Vault reflects additional risk considerations stemming from newer
  assets like Lombard BTC, or LBTC, which represents Bitcoin staked into Babylon
  by Lombard. Babylon is analogous to Eigenlayer, and allows the economic
  security guarantees of Bitcoin to be extended to other protocols, which should
  eventually become a yield-bearing Bitcoin derivative.
- **Market Positioning:**  
  By clearly delineating the vault as part of the Frontier series, Moonwell
  avoids user confusion with Flagship Vaults, which cater to a more conservative
  risk appetite.
- **Appealing to Advanced Users:**  
  The name emphasizes our commitment to empowering advanced DeFi users with
  innovative opportunities.

### **Why cbBTC?**

The timing for launching the Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault is critical, as DeFi
activity surrounding cbBTC on Base has surged.

- **Impressive cbBTC Metrics on Base**: Over 4,054 cbBTC (~$2B) is currently
  deployed on Base, demonstrating significant interest in the asset.
  Furthermore, Aerodrome's WETH/cbBTC and USDC/cbBTC concentrated liquidity
  pools are the #2 and #3 highest volume pools on the DEX with over $2B of
  combined volume. These pools represent lucrative opportunities for LPs and
  will likely bolster borrowing demand for cbBTC.
- **High Borrowing Demand Potential**: Market data indicates that cbBTC is a
  highly sought-after asset for LPs and leveraged strategies, making this an
  ideal time to establish a dedicated lending vault to capture this activity.

Moonwell's Frontier cbBTC Vault aims to capitalize on this momentum while
offering users competitive rates and a seamless lending experience.

### Strategic Opportunities

- **Enhanced APYs:** Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault suppliers will benefit from
  competitive yields, including WELL and MORPHO incentives, creating a
  compelling value proposition for vault depositors.
- **Diverse Market Options:** The Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault will supply into
  markets such as USDC/cbBTC and ETH/cbBTC, and potentially expand into
  restaking derivative markets in the future, enabling broader participation and
  bolstering adoption through strategic liquidity deployment.

## Proposal Submission Limit Adjustment

To streamline governance and maintain an efficient voting process, this proposal
also introduces a limit of two active proposals per contributor at any given
time. This housekeeping measure is designed to enhance the governance experience
by reducing voter fatigue and ensuring a more focused discussion on active
proposals.

### Implementation

If this proposal passes, the following actions will be executed:

1. Transfer 18M WELL tokens to the
   [Moonwell Morpho URD contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x9e3380f8b29e8f85ca19effa80fb41149417d943)
2. Continue existing distribution mechanism through merkle roots
3. Maintain current operational handling of incentives by the Morpho DAO
4. Cap the total number of active proposals per contributor at two

## **Voting Options**

- **Yay:** Approve the renewal grant of 18M WELL token incentives for Moonwell
  Flagship and Frontier Vaults, the transfer of ownership for the Moonwell
  Frontier cbBTC Vault to the Moonwell DAO, and the introduction of a cap on the
  number of active proposals per contributor.
- **Nay:** Reject the renewal of WELL token incentives, the transfer of cbBTC
  Vault ownership, and the proposed cap on active proposals.
- **Abstain:** Choose to participate in the vote without expressing support or
  opposition to the proposal.

## Conclusion

The Moonwell Flagship Vaults have become a cornerstone of Moonwell's lending
ecosystem, delivering unparalleled market dominance, strong user adoption, and
consistent TVL growth. Renewing this program aligns perfectly with Moonwell's
mission to simplify lending for everyone while reinforcing our leadership on
Morpho.

Additionally, the introduction of the Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault positions
Moonwell to capitalize on the explosive growth of cbBTC and other Bitcoin
derivatives on Base. By leveraging cbBTC's high demand and significant
liquidity, this vault aims to attract substantial borrowing activity while
offering suppliers competitive yields.

With 18 million WELL tokens dedicated to liquidity incentives and a performance
fee structure designed to increasingly benefit the Moonwell DAO as Vault TVLs
grow, this proposal ensures long-term sustainability and rewards continued
success. With over 22,000 depositors in Flagship Vaults and approximately $170M
in TVL, this proposal represents a scalable and strategic approach to sustaining
Moonwell's momentum, maintaining market leadership, and advancing its mission to
make onchain finance accessible, secure, and simple for all.
